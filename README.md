# LLVM beginner <br/> LLVM Cook Book #
The repository is to store my learning process of LLVM following the LLVM-Cook-Book and offical documents.

The [notes](notes.md) file will have the helpful notes of each chapter and modified commands. As the book is old for newer version of LLVM it will change slightly. For each chapter there will be deticated folder for the codes.
